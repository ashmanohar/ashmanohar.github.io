I'm a PhD Candidate in the department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of California San Diego, where I'm currently pursuing my doctoral studies under the guidance of Dr. Elliot McVeigh.

Prior to joining UC San Diego, I earned my BE in mechanical engineering from the R.V. College of Engineering, India.

My research interests include the improvement of non-invasive imaging systems for the better diagnosis of heart disease. In particular, my doctoral research is focused on improving the accuracy of measuring regional cardiac function using x-ray CT. I am the recipient of the American Heart Association Predoctoral Fellowship and the Siemens Young Scientist Award.

Outside of academia, I enjoy biking, playing tennis, and multi-day backcountry hiking.
