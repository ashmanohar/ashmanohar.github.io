I'm currently a Postdoctoral Scholar in the department of Bioengineering at the University of California San Diego. My research interests include the improvement of non-invasive imaging systems for the better diagnosis of heart disease.

I completed my PhD under the guidance of [Dr. Elliot McVeigh](https://iem.ucsd.edu/researchers/people/profiles/elliot-mcveigh.html), where I focused my efforts on improving the spatio-temporal resolution of regional cardiac function assessment using 4DCT. Prior to joining the doctoral program, I earned my MS in mechanical engineering from UC San Diego, where I worked with [Dr. Juan Carlos del Alamo](https://www.engr.washington.edu/facresearch/newfaculty/2019/delAlamo) to develop tools for the quantitative characterization of the texture of the left ventricular endocardium.

I am the recipient of the [American Heart Association Predoctoral Fellowship](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/application-information/predoctoral-fellowship) and the Siemens Young Scientist Award by [SPIE Medical Imaging](https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/medical-imaging).

Outside of academia, I enjoy biking, playing tennis, and multi-day backcountry hiking.
