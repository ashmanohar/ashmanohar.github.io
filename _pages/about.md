I'm a PhD Candidate in the department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of California San Diego, where I'm currently pursuing my doctoral studies under the guidance of [Dr. Elliot McVeigh](https://iem.ucsd.edu/researchers/people/profiles/elliot-mcveigh.html).

Prior to joining UC San Diego, I earned my BE in mechanical engineering from the R.V. College of Engineering, India.

My research interests include the improvement of non-invasive imaging systems for the better diagnosis of heart disease. In particular, my doctoral research is focused on improving the accuracy of measuring regional cardiac function using 4DCT.

I am the recipient of the [American Heart Association Predoctoral Fellowship](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/application-information/predoctoral-fellowship) and the Siemens Young Scientist Award by [SPIE Medical Imaging](https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/medical-imaging).

Outside of academia, I enjoy biking, playing tennis, and multi-day backcountry hiking.
