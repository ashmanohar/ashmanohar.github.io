Welcome to my page!

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, with an adjunct appointment in the Department of Radiology. Prior to joining UW, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at Stanford University, working with [Dr. Koen Nieman](https://profiles.stanford.edu/koen-nieman). I earned my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California San Diego, where I worked with [Dr. Elliot McVeigh](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/profile?id=399) on cardiac CT imaging.

My research focuses on developing advanced CT imaging methods to improve disease diagnosis and management, with a particular emphasis on cardiovascular disease. I work at the intersection of imaging physics, medical image analysis, and computational modeling to derive quantitative biomarkers of cardiac structure and function.

I am grateful to the [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/) for supporting my research through [Predoctoral](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/application-information/predoctoral-fellowship) and [Postdoctoral](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/aha-funding-opportunities/postdoctoral-fellowship) Fellowships. I was also honored to receive the Siemens Healthineers Young Scientist Award.

Outside of the lab, I enjoy live music, playing tennis, hikes and bike rides, and exploring Seattle's craft brewery scene.
