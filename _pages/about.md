Welcome to my page! I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar in the department of Cardiovascular Medicine at Stanford University, working with [Dr. Koen Nieman](https://profiles.stanford.edu/koen-nieman). My primary research focus is on developing imaging algorithms to facilitate robust quantification and diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.

During my PhD, under the supervision of [Dr. Elliot McVeigh](https://iem.ucsd.edu/researchers/people/profiles/elliot-mcveigh.html), I focused on improving the spatio-temporal resolution of regional cardiac function assessment using 4-dimensional computed tomography. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned an MS in mechanical engineering from UC San Diego, where I worked with [Dr. Juan Carlos del Alamo](https://www.engr.washington.edu/facresearch/newfaculty/2019/delAlamo) to develop tools for the quantitative characterization of the texture of the human left ventricle.

My research has been supported by the [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/) through [Predoctoral](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/application-information/predoctoral-fellowship) and [Postdoctoral](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/aha-funding-opportunities/postdoctoral-fellowship) Fellowships. Additionally, I am the recipient of the 2019 Siemens Young Scientist Award by [SPIE Medical Imaging](https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/medical-imaging).

Beyond science, I enjoy shoegaze music, playing tennis, multi-day backcountry hiking, and exploring local craft breweries.
