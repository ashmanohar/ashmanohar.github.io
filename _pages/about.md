Welcome to my page!

I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at Stanford University, working with [Dr. Koen Nieman](https://profiles.stanford.edu/koen-nieman). My research focuses on developing advanced medical imaging algorithms for the accurate and precise estimation of quantitative imaging features, with a particular emphasis on diagnosing and understanding cardiovascular disease.

I earned my PhD in mechanical engineering from the University of California San Diego, under the guidance of [Dr. Elliot McVeigh](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/profile?id=399). My dissertation introduced innovative imaging technologies for high-fidelity estimation of cardiac mechanics, including a high-resolution endocardial strain estimation algorithm and a novel cardiac CT motion correction algorithm. 

I am grateful to the [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/) for supporting my reserach through [Predoctoral](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/application-information/predoctoral-fellowship) and [Postdoctoral](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/aha-funding-opportunities/postdoctoral-fellowship) Fellowships. I was also honored to receive the Siemens Young Scientist Award from [SPIE Medical Imaging](https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/medical-imaging).

Outside of the lab, I enjoy shoegaze music, playing tennis, multi-day backcountry hikes, and discovering local craft breweries.

<!-- For my masterâ€™s thesis at UC San Diego, I collaborated with [Dr. Juan Carlos del Alamo](https://www.engr.washington.edu/facresearch/newfaculty/2019/delAlamo) to develop robust image-based tools for quantitative characterization of the texture of the left ventricular myocardium. -->
