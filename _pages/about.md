Welcome to my page! I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar in the department of Cardiovascular Medicine at Stanford University, mentored by [Dr. Koen Nieman](https://profiles.stanford.edu/koen-nieman). My primary research focus is on advancing imaging tools and techniques to enhance the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.

During my PhD, supervised by [Dr. Elliot McVeigh](https://iem.ucsd.edu/researchers/people/profiles/elliot-mcveigh.html), I focused my efforts on improving the spatio-temporal resolution of regional cardiac function assessment using 4-dimensional computed tomography. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned an MS in mechanical engineering from UC San Diego, where I worked with [Dr. Juan Carlos del Alamo](https://www.engr.washington.edu/facresearch/newfaculty/2019/delAlamo) on developing tools for the quantitative characterization of the texture of the human left ventricle.

I am grateful to the [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/) for supporting my research through [Predoctoral](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/application-information/predoctoral-fellowship) and [Postdoctoral](https://professional.heart.org/en/research-programs/aha-funding-opportunities/postdoctoral-fellowship) Fellowships. I am also the recipient of the Siemens Young Scientist Award by [SPIE Medical Imaging](https://spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/medical-imaging).

Beyond science, I enjoy shoegaze music, playing tennis, multi-day backcountry hiking, and exploring local craft breweries.
